Shall I compare thee to a <noun>’s <noun>?
Thou art more <adjective> and more <adjective>:
Rough <plural noun> do shake the <adjective> <noun> of May,
And <noun>’s lease hath all too <adjective> a <noun>:
Sometime too <adjective> the <noun> of heaven shines,
And often is his <adjective> complexion dimm’d;
And every <noun>  from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s <ing verb> <noun> untrimm’d;
But thy eternal <noun> shall not <verb>
Nor lose possession of that <noun> thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his <noun-place>,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can <verb> or  <noun>  can <verb>,
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
